allows playing games like Subway Surfers without a 
keyboard, using only real-time hand movements captured via a webcam. The solution leverages 
MediaPipe and OpenCV for gesture detection and tracking, implementing swipe-based controls (left, 
right, up for jump, down for slide) and triggering in-game actions through simulated keyboard inputs. This 
project combines computer vision and human-computer interaction techniques to deliver an intuitive, 
hands-free gaming experience.
